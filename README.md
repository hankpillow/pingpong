## Pingpong

THIS IS A PERSONAL PROJECT!

It is designed to cURL [information](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html#-w) from a file with urls in it.

The idea is to have a lightweight container using `crontab` and `jq` to fetch data and save them on JSON file.

----

## Setup

You must create a list of urls and share it (via shared volumes) with the container.

i.e: `echo http://reddit.com > URLS'

The `URLS` file is a text file containing one url per line.

	http://www.google.com
	# lines starting with sharp (#) will be ignored
	# http://this.line.will.be/ignored
	https://my-protected-page.com username:password

> The user and password are sent via [cURL -u](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html#-u)

----

## Log Success

All logs will be saved at `/var/pingpong/logs/samples.json` (container's path)

> the information collected came from [cURL -w](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html#-w) command. Check there for more info.

When cURL finishes with `exit 0` a new sample will be pushed into `/var/pingpong/logs/samples.json` file.

All samples follow the format:

```json
{
  "date": "2018-01-03_17:39:49",
  "http_code": "200",
  "http_connect": "000",
  "http_version": "1.1",
  "num_connects": "2",
  "num_redirects": "1",
  "proxy_ssl_verify_result": "0",
  "redirect_url": "",
  "remote_ip": "52.72.116.221",
  "remote_port": "443",
  "scheme": "HTTPS",
  "size_download": "0",
  "size_header": "312",
  "size_request": "442",
  "size_upload": "0",
  "speed_download": "0.000",
  "speed_upload": "0.000",
  "ssl_verify_result": "0",
  "time_appconnect": "0.478933",
  "time_connect": "0.153941",
  "time_namelookup": "0.004277",
  "time_pretransfer": "0.478985",
  "time_redirect": "0.350364",
  "time_starttransfer": "0.674499",
  "time_total": "1.024888",
  "url_effective": "https://hub.docker.com/"
}
```
## Log Error

All logs will be saved at `/var/pingpong/logs/errors.json` (container's path)

When cURL exit code is *not 0* a new error will be pushed into `/var/pingpong/logs/errors.json` file.

All errors follow the format:

```json
{
  "date": "2018-01-03_17:39:54",
  "url": "http://reddddit.com",
  "error_code": "56"
}

```

----

## Getting started

1. Make sure you have the URLS file and a logs folder (`mkdir ./logs`)

2. start the container as daemon and share the URLS and the log folder  as volume

```
docker run -d \
   -v $(pwd)/URLS:/var/URLS \
   -v $(pwd)/logs:/var/logs:rw \
   mrboots/pingpong
```

Now you can check the activity via `tail -f ./log/*`

> by default the container will run every minute, so wait for a minute at least to see the results

----

## Container Config

All config must be provided via environment variable

* `FOLLOW_LINKS` - default `1` (0|1). Define whether redirects should be followed [@see cURL -L flag](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html#-L) (when following links you won't see redirect status code, intead the final status code + _num_redirects_ updated.

* `MAX_TIME` - default `10` (time in sec). Define the request's timeout. [@see cURL --max-time](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html#-m)

* `CRON_MINUTE` - defautl `*`

* `CRON_HOUR` - defautl `*`

* `CRON_DAY_MONTH` - defautl `*`

* `CRON_MONTH` - defautl `*`

* `CRON_DAY_WEEK` - defautl `*`

* *TBD* `MAX_SAMPLES` - default `100000` - the amount of itens inside the samples.log

* *TBD* `MAX_ERRORS` - default `100000` - the amount of itens inside the errors.log
